# {octicon}`chevron-right` Try Online

Before you go through the trouble of installing the package on your machine, why not give it a try online first? There's no reason to spend the time with setting up your dev enviroment, if you end up finding out that this is not useful to you. Save the time so you can spend it reconciling your data instead.

If you are already familiar with a programming language, you should be able to get through this sandbox tutorial pretty quickly. While knowing python is not really required for this sandbox tutorial, you'll want to brush up your basic python skills before working on the more in depth Onboarding Tutorials following installation.

This online sandbox tutorial is set up for you to "fill in the blanks". Basically, most of the code is already completed, except for a small piece of code in each line for you to fill in. It's up to you to figure out what goes in there, but we, the code volunteers are ready to answer any questions you may have, on GitHub.

Time recommended: **1 hour**

You can open the sandbox tutorial in one of two ways. You may be forced to use one or another, especially if you are a company network with strict network firewall rules.

- Open in [Google Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/casact/chainladder-python/blob/master/docs/getting_started/online_sandbox/sandbox_workbook_blank.ipynb) (faster, but a free Google Account is required)

- Open in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/casact/chainladder-python/master?urlpath=tree/docs/getting_started/online_sandbox/sandbox_workbook_blank.ipynb) (slower, no sign up required)
