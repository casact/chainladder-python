> prism.groupby('Line').sum()

  pandas
- Added `model_diagnostics` utility function to be used on fitted
  estimators.

  functions can be called on Triangles. For example:

  \>\>\> np.sin(cl.load_sample('raa'))

  val_to_dev with malformed triangle

**Enhancements**

- Major overhaul of Triangle internals for better code clarity and
  more efficiency
- Made sparse operations more efficient for larger triangles
- `to_frame` now works on Triangles that are 3D or 4D. For example
  `clrd.to_frame()`
- Advanced `groupby` operations supported. For (trivial) example:

> \>\>\> clrd = cl.load_sample('clrd') \>\>\> \# Split companies with
> names less than 15 characters vs those above: \>\>\>
> clrd.groupby(clrd.index['GRNAME'].str.len()\<15).sum()

> > :48]

- [\#92](https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/issues/92)
  to_frame() now takes optional `origin_as_datetime` argument for
  better compatibility with various plotting libraries (Thank you
  [johalnes](https://github.com/johalnes) )

  and `val_to_dev`
- Reduced footprint of `ldf_`, `sigma`, and `std_err_` triangles
