### Version 0.8.5

Release Date: Jul 11, 2021

**Enhancements**

- [\#154](https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/issues/154) -
  Added groupby hyperparameter to several more estimators including
  the widely used Development estimator. This allows fitting
  development patterns at a higher grain than the Triangle all within
  the estiamtor or Pipeline.
- Improved index broadcasting for sparse arrays. Prior to 0.8.5, this
  code would inappropriately consume too much memory. For example:

> \>\>\> prism = cl.load_sample('prism') \>\>\> prism /
> prism.groupby('Line').sum()

- Arithmetic label matching improved for all axes to align more with
  pandas
- Added `model_diagnostics` utility function to be used on fitted
  estimators.
- Initial support for `dask` arrays. Current support is basic, but
  will eventually allow for distributed computations on massive
  triangles.
- added numpy array protocol support to the Triangle class. Now numpy
  functions can be called on Triangles. For example:

  \>\>\> np.sin(cl.load_sample('raa'))

- [\#169](https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/issues/169) -
  Made Triangle tutorial more beginner friendly - courtesy of
  [kennethshsu](https://github.com/kennethshsu)

**Bug Fixes**

- Better Estimator pickling support when callables are included in
  estimators.
- Minor bug fix in grain estimator.

### Version 0.8.4

Release Date: May 9, 2021

**Enhancements**

- [\#153](https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/issues/153) -
  Introduced CapeCod `groupby` parameter that allows for apriori
  computation at user-specified grain for granular triangles
- [\#154](https://github.com/casact/chainladder-python/issues/154) -
  Introduced `groupby` support in key development estimators
