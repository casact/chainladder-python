class TailConstant(TailBase):
    """Allows for the entry of a constant tail factor to LDFs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tail: float
        The constant to apply to all LDFs within a triangle object.
    decay: float (default=0.50)
        An exponential decay constant that allows for decay over future
        development periods.  A decay rate of 0.5 sets the development portion
        of each successive LDF to 50% of the previous LDF.
    attachment_age: int (default=None)
        The age at which to attach the fitted curve.  If None, then the latest
        age is used. Measures of variability from original ``ldf_`` are retained
        when being used in conjunction with the MackChainladder method.
    projection_period: int
        The number of months beyond the latest available development age the
        `ldf_` and `cdf_` vectors should extend.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ldf_:
        ldf with tail applied.
    cdf_:
        cdf with tail applied.
    tail_: DataFrame
        Point estimate of tail at latest maturity available in the Triangle.

    Notes
    -----
    The tail constant does not support the entry of variability parameters
    necessary for stochastic approaches, so any usage of TailConstant will be
    inherently deterministic.
