class Development(DevelopmentBase):
    """A Transformer that allows for basic loss development pattern selection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_periods: integer, optional (default = -1)
        number of origin periods to be used in the ldf average calculation. For
        all origin periods, set n_periods = -1
    average: string or float, optional (default = 'volume')
        type of averaging to use for ldf average calculation.  Options include
        'volume', 'simple', and 'regression'. If numeric values are supplied,
        then (2-average) in the style of Zehnwirth & Barnett is used
        for the exponent of the regression weights.
    sigma_interpolation: string optional (default = 'log-linear')
        Options include 'log-linear' and 'mack'
    drop: tuple or list of tuples
        Drops specific origin/development combination(s)
    drop_high: bool, int, list of bools, or list of ints (default = None)
        Drops highest (by rank) link ratio(s) from LDF calculation
        If a boolean variable is passed, drop_high is set to 1, dropping only the
        highest value
        Note that drop_high is performed after consideration of n_periods (if used)
    drop_low: bool, int, list of bools, or list of ints (default = None)
        Drops lowest (by rank) link ratio(s) from LDF calculation
        If a boolean variable is passed, drop_low is set to 1, dropping only the
        lowest value
        Note that drop_low is performed after consideration of n_periods (if used)
    drop_above: float or list of floats (default = numpy.inf)
        Drops all link ratio(s) above the given parameter from the LDF calculation
    drop_below: float or list of floats (default = 0.00)
        Drops all link ratio(s) below the given parameter from the LDF calculation
    preserve: int (default = 1)
        The minimum number of link ratio(s) required for LDF calculation
    drop_valuation: str or list of str (default = None)
        Drops specific valuation periods. str must be date convertible.
    fillna: float, (default = None)
        Used to fill in zero or nan values of an triangle with some non-zero
        amount.  When an link-ratio has zero as its denominator, it is automatically
        excluded from the ``ldf_`` calculation.  For the specific case of 'volume'
        averaging in a deterministic method, this may be reasonable.  For all other
        averages and stochastic methods, this assumption should be avoided.
    groupby:
        An option to group levels of the triangle index together for the purposes
        of estimating patterns.  If omitted, each level of the triangle
        index will receive its own patterns.


    Attributes
    ----------
    ldf_: Triangle
        The estimated loss development patterns
    cdf_: Triangle
        The estimated cumulative development patterns
    sigma_: Triangle
        Sigma of the ldf regression
    std_err_: Triangle
        Std_err of the ldf regression
    std_residuals_: Triangle
        A Triangle representing the weighted standardized residuals of the
        estimator as described in Barnett and Zehnwirth.
